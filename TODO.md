## General
* Add URLs to Shopify API docs
* Add timeout option to all requests
* Handle/test bad `access_token`/`password`
* More browser tests
* maybe call this.debugLog instead of console.log, then one lint ignore can cover that and other console.logs will be detected
* Store API rate limit info and request queue (or at least count) in a global object which times out when the timers are done
